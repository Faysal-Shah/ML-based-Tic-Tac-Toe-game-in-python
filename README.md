# ML-based-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-in-python
Developed AlphaX, a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe bot using Q-Learning and optionally Deep Q-Networks (DQN). Features include interactive Tkinter GUI, self-play training, model saving/loading, and human vs AI gameplay. This project demonstrates practical reinforcement learning, adaptive strategy development, and explainable AI concepts.
